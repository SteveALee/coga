      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <p>
        Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with
        cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and
        making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in
        vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help
        people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about
        context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact
        everyone to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and
        applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by
        providing guidance for your designs, and design process.
      </p>

      <section id="process">
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>
          Some aspects of making web content and applications friendly for
          people with cognitive impairments are best dealt with as part of the
          overall design process. For most organizations there should be scope
          included for a
          <a
            href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html"
            >user-centred design process</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key parts of this process for people with cognitive impairments should
          be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Including the needs of users with cognitive impairments in the
            context of use and requirements;
          </li>
          <li>
            Including people with cognitive impairments in research methods such
            as usability testing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If people with cognitive impairments are included in the usability
          testing and their feedback is accounted for, you can be sure that the
          website will be easier to use for everyone. (See
          <a href="#testing_groups_feedback">Usability testing</a>, below)
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="scale">
        <h2>Applicability across websites</h2>
        <p>
          The amount of effort an organization should expend on making a website
          friendly for people with cognitive impairments will vary. For
          organizations that provide public services, or are national (or
          international) private service providers and already conduct
          user-research, they should:
        </p>
        <p>
          Organizations that conduct user research should include people with
          learning and cognitive disabilities as part of user research such as
          usability-testing. This is particularly important for public service
          providers as well as national and international private service
          providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          All organizations, regardless of user research conducted, should
          review designs and early stage development with the design objectives
          in this document.

        <h1>
          Background about people with learning and cognitive disabilities and
          the web
        </h1>
        <p>
          People with cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to
          effectively use web content because of the design and content choices
          of the author. Examples may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People with impaired short term memory may be unable to recall
            passwords or copy access codes. They may have trouble or be unable
            to remember new symbols and interface paradigms;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with different processing speed capabilities may need
            additional time to understand the design relationships and volume of
            information on screen;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with language related disabilities may need simple clear
            language and instructions. Some may rely on supporting graphics and
            familiar symbols to understand content;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with social and/or communication disabilities may need clear
            literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal
            text and symbols;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with dyscalculia may not understand or confuse numerical
            references such as percentages;
          </li>
          <li>
            People who have issues with keeping or regaining focus, may be have
            difficulty completing a simple task if there are lots of
            distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts
            to help them regain the context after their attention has been lost
            (including in multimedia);
          </li>
          <li>
            Many groups will need support to minimize errors and complete their
            task. They will struggle with complex, multi-stage processes such as
            filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content
            or feature that they need.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These difficulties may sometimes also be experienced by users in the
          general population due to environmental or situational barriers, such
          as when they are trying to use a website when they are distracted. For
          example working on a mobile device while in an unfamiliar or noisy
          situations can demand place addition cognitive load on all users by
          splitting their attention. However, for users with cognitive and
          learning disabilities, these difficulties are likely to be persistent
          and significant, so that they are unable to access content and abandon
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cognitive and learning disabilities include long-term and short-term
          and and sometimes permanent difficulties relating to cognitive
          functions, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>perception, memory and attention;</li>
          <li>learning and orientation;</li>
          <li>visual, verbal and numerical thinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are usually hidden difficulties and may be age related. The
          terminology and definitions used for cognitive disabilities varies
          between countries and users are less likely to have a formal diagnosis
          of a disability than individuals with physical and sensory
          difficulties. Cognitive disabilities may include intellectual
          impairments affecting comprehension alongside written and spoken
          expression. People may also experience a co-occurrence of difficulties
          such as dyspraxia / developmental coordination difficulties and ADHD
          should also be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that by addressing barriers to accessibility for
          users with cognitive and learning disabilities, improvements to
          digital technologies can be achieved and there is the potential to
          improve user experience for everyone.

      <p>
        Any time there is a 'target audience', there will be people with with
        learning and cognitive disabilities in that audience. Cognitive
        impairments are often invisible in day-to-day life until people
        encounter particular challenges. To provide some context and
        understanding, eight personas have been created which outline fictional
        people with various cognitive impairments and the challenges they face.

      <h1>Usability Testing, Focus Groups and Feedback</h1>
      <p>
        Usability testing is the best way to know if your content and
        functionality works for real people with cognitive and learning
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <div>

          width="600"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        Usability is important for everyone. If web content and applications are
        difficult to use, they cannot be accessible for people with cognitive
        disabilities. Automated testing for accessibility focuses on more
        technical areas of accessibility, and cannot assess ease of use. It is
        vital for people with cognitive disabilities that development teams do
        not rely solely on automated accessibility testing, but incorporate
        Design Patterns as described in the Appendix, and if possible test with
        people who have cognitive disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding people to include in usability testing who have different
        learning and cognitive disabilities can be relatively easy, such as
        friends, colleagues, relatives or neighbors who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Are older and struggle to use computers, or have age-related
          forgetfulness;
        </li>
        <li>
          Are at an early stage of dementia

        <h2>Differences from usability testing with the general population</h2>
        <p>
          There are some differences when testing for accessibility, and that
          includes when testing with people who have cognitive impairments:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ensure that the participation forms are easy to understand, send
              them to the participant in advance, and allow plenty of time for
              the participant to ask questions and fill in forms;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Allow the participant to bring a carer, family member or friend to
              attend with them. If your tester has a guardian you should get
              informed consent from both the tester and their guardian;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It helps to provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than
              asking for the participant to verbalize, try asking them to select
              a smiley face, such as:<br />
              <figure>
                <img
                  src="img/faces-happy-to-sad.png"
                  width="200"
                  alt="a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad."
                />
                <figcaption>A simple mood selector</figcaption>
              </figure>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making
              mistakes. While this is always important during usability testing,
              this scenario is even more likely for people with cognitive
              impairments.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some brief guidance on usability testing:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Can your users ( people with learning and cognitive disabilities)
            manage each task reasonably easily and fast. You can time the task
            taken to complete, and note any parts that where the users are
            slowed down or seem to struggle. Also note any errors that they
            making including clicking on the wrong thing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Is completing the task frustrating or upsetting?
            <ol>
              <li>
                You can ask the users how they are feeling before and after the
                tasks (or rate their mode such as selecting the smiley which
                represents how they feel, such as:
              </li>
              <li>ask them if anything was annoying.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How can you make it better for your users ( people with learning
              and cognitive disabilities)
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>You can analyze the data collected above</li>
              <li>
                ask them how they feel about the system and if anything was
                annoying.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If the user if failing blame the designer and not the user. Such
              as “ it is so helpful that you are doing this because our
              designers are not very good, or are always playing computer games
              so they think everyone is good at this stuff” or “you are really
              helping us make this useable by real people and not just
              engineers” . Stop the process if users are getting distressed
              despite this.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As a short overview, usability could be measured based on efficacy,
          efficiency and satisfaction. This can be done by measuring or
          tracking:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>successes and noting any errors to measure efficacy,</li>
          <li>
            time taken per task to measure efficiency, note that the relative
            time between tasks is often more useful than absolute numbers. and
          </li>
          <li>user’s mood and comments to measure satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the end of the evaluation you should be able to answer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What prevents the user from completing a task?</li>
          <li>
            What creates confusion? When and why do they misinterpret the
            interface?
          </li>
          <li>What produces an error and an incorrect action?</li>
          <li>When does the user get frustrated or upset</li>
          <li>
            When does the user misunderstand navigation, menus and controls?
          </li>
          <li>How can these problems be avoided?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note you will need to get informed consent from the tester before
          testing. Explain what they will be doing and why it is helping you. If
          there are any risks they need to be explained and understood. If your
          tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the
          tester and their guardian. Make sure potential participants are aware
          they can withdraw from the testing situation at any time and that
          their comments will be anonymised before being used in any report.

      <h1>Design Objectives</h1>
      <p>
        To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive
        and learning disabilities we have identified the following objectives:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Design so that as many users as possible understand the site and
              know how to use it. </strong
            >This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the
            user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design
            patterns. Personalization and good use of semantics can help make
            the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. People
            with cognitive disabilities rely upon predictable behavior in
            digital content. For example, many websites do not follow the
            standard convention for hyperlinks: blue = unvisited; purple =
            visited; and underlined. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme1">design guide</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Help the user find what they need. </strong>Navigating the
            system should be easy. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme2"
              >design guide for navigation</a
            >.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use clear and understandable content</strong> This includes
            clear text, clear images, speech, and easy to understand video. See
            the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme3"
              >design guide for understandable content.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct
              mistakes when they do occur.</strong
            >
            A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but
            when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without
            having to render other data or start from the beginning. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme4"
              >design guide for errors.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Help the user focus and restore context if attention is
              lost.</strong
            >
            Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user
            restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable
            can also help the user undo mistakes.) See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme5"
              >design guide for focus.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and
              avoid barriers</strong
            >
            that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content,
            such as hard to use security mechanisms. When possible, provide more
            accessible options. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme6"
              >design guide for barriers.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Provide help and support.</strong> Graphics, summaries of
            long documents, adding icons to headings and links are all examples
            of extra help and support. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme7"
              >design guide for support.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Feedback is usable by everyone.</strong> If users have
            difficulty sending feedback then you will not know if they are able
            to use the content or when they are experiencing problems.
            Therefore, it is essential that all the feedback mechanisms are
            tested by people with cognitive disabilities. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme8"
              >design guide for feedback.</a
            >
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

        Note that most of the design patterns in the guide were originally
        created as recommendations for WCAG, the
