      <p>
        Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with
        cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally accessibility has been most focused on the interface, and
        making that usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in
        vision, hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features will help
        people with cognitive impairments, but often the issues are about
        context, language, usability, and other more general factors that impact
        everyone to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and
        applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by

        <p>
          Some aspects of making web content and applications friendly for
          people with cognitive impairments are best dealt with as part of the
          overall design process. For most organizations there should be scope
          included for a
          <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-centered-design.html">user-centred design process</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Key parts of this process for people with cognitive impairments should
          be:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Including the needs of users with cognitive impairments in the
            context of use and requirements;
          </li>
          <li>
            Including people with cognitive impairments in research methods such
            as usability testing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If people with cognitive impairments are included in the usability
          testing and their feedback is accounted for, you can be sure that the
          website will be easier to use for everyone. (See
          <a href="#testing_groups_feedback">Usability testing</a>, below)

        <p>
          The amount of effort an organization should expend on making a website
          friendly for people with cognitive impairments will vary. For
          organizations that provide public services, or are national (or
          international) private service providers and already conduct
          user-research, they should:
        </p>
        <p>
          Organizations that conduct user research should include people with
          learning and cognitive disabilities as part of user research such as
          usability-testing. This is particularly important for public service
          providers as well as national and international private service
          providers.
        </p>
        <p>
          All organizations, regardless of user research conducted, should
          review designs and early stage development with the design objectives
          in this document.

          Background about People with Learning and Cognitive Disabilities and the Web
        <a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#background"></a></h3>
        <p>
          People with cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to
          effectively use web content because of the design and content choices
          of the author. Examples may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            People with impaired short term memory may be unable to recall
            passwords or copy access codes. They may have trouble or be unable
            to remember new symbols and interface paradigms;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with different processing speed capabilities may need
            additional time to understand the design relationships and volume of
            information on screen;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with language related disabilities may need simple clear
            language and instructions. Some may rely on supporting graphics and
            familiar symbols to understand content;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with social and/or communication disabilities may need clear
            literal language and may not understand metaphors or non-literal
            text and symbols;
          </li>
          <li>
            People with dyscalculia may not understand or confuse numerical
            references such as percentages;
          </li>
          <li>
            People who have issues with keeping or regaining focus, may be have
            difficulty completing a simple task if there are lots of
            distractions and interruptions. They may need headers and signposts
            to help them regain the context after their attention has been lost
            (including in multimedia);
          </li>
          <li>
            Many groups will need support to minimize errors and complete their
            task. They will struggle with complex, multi-stage processes such as
            filling out forms or entering data correctly or finding the content
            or feature that they need.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These difficulties may sometimes also be experienced by users in the
          general population due to environmental or situational barriers, such
          as when they are trying to use a website when they are distracted. For
          example working on a mobile device while in an unfamiliar or noisy
          situations can demand place addition cognitive load on all users by
          splitting their attention. However, for users with cognitive and
          learning disabilities, these difficulties are likely to be persistent
          and significant, so that they are unable to access content and abandon
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cognitive and learning disabilities include long-term and short-term
          and and sometimes permanent difficulties relating to cognitive
          functions, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>perception, memory and attention;</li>
          <li>learning and orientation;</li>
          <li>visual, verbal and numerical thinking.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These are usually hidden difficulties and may be age related. The
          terminology and definitions used for cognitive disabilities varies
          between countries and users are less likely to have a formal diagnosis
          of a disability than individuals with physical and sensory
          difficulties. Cognitive disabilities may include intellectual
          impairments affecting comprehension alongside written and spoken
          expression. People may also experience a co-occurrence of difficulties
          such as dyspraxia / developmental coordination difficulties and ADHD
          should also be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
          It should be noted that by addressing barriers to accessibility for
          users with cognitive and learning disabilities, improvements to
          digital technologies can be achieved and there is the potential to
          improve user experience for everyone.

        Any time there is a 'target audience', there will be people with with
        learning and cognitive disabilities in that audience. Cognitive
        impairments are often invisible in day-to-day life until people
        encounter particular challenges. To provide some context and
        understanding, eight personas have been created which outline fictional
        people with various cognitive impairments and the challenges they face.

        Usability testing is the best way to know if your content and
        functionality works for real people with cognitive and learning
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <div>
        <img alt="aspects for providing guidance, include usability, accessibility, reliably testable accessibility and automatically testable accessibility " src="img/guidance_aspect.png" width="600" height="486">
      </div>
      <p>
        Usability is important for everyone. If web content and applications are
        difficult to use, they cannot be accessible for people with cognitive
        disabilities. Automated testing for accessibility focuses on more
        technical areas of accessibility, and cannot assess ease of use. It is
        vital for people with cognitive disabilities that development teams do
        not rely solely on automated accessibility testing, but incorporate
        Design Patterns as described in the Appendix, and if possible test with
        people who have cognitive disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding people to include in usability testing who have different
        learning and cognitive disabilities can be relatively easy, such as
        friends, colleagues, relatives or neighbors who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Are older and struggle to use computers, or have age-related
          forgetfulness;
        </li>
        <li>
          Are at an early stage of dementia
        </li>
        <li>
          Have dyslexia, dyscalculia or ADHD
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a learning or intellectual disability
        </li>
        <li>
          People with acquired cognitive issues (for example, due to
          neurological trauma) who have the same challenges as people with other
          disabilities such as:
          <ul>
            <li>
              having difficulty (asking a family member to help) with booking
              travel booking or hotel booking online
            </li>
            <li>being unable to use online banking</li>
            <li>
              coping with content forms and pop up windows when errors occur

            <p>
              Ensure that the participation forms are easy to understand, send

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Allow the participant to bring a carer, family member or friend to
              attend with them. If your tester has a guardian you should get
              informed consent from both the tester and their guardian;
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It helps to provide easy methods of assessing mood, rather than
              asking for the participant to verbalize, try asking them to select
              a smiley face, such as:<br>
              </p><figure id="fig-a-simple-mood-selector">
                <img src="img/faces-happy-to-sad.png" alt="a set of 5 smiley faces from happy, through neutral, to sad." width="200">
                <figcaption>Figure <bdi class="figno">1</bdi> <span class="fig-title">A simple mood selector</span></figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ensure the person does not feel like they are at fault for making
              mistakes. While this is always important during usability testing,
              this scenario is even more likely for people with cognitive
              impairments.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some brief guidance on usability testing:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Can your users ( people with learning and cognitive disabilities)
            manage each task reasonably easily and fast. You can time the task
            taken to complete, and note any parts that where the users are
            slowed down or seem to struggle. Also note any errors that they
            making including clicking on the wrong thing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Is completing the task frustrating or upsetting?
            <ol>
              <li>
                You can ask the users how they are feeling before and after the
                tasks (or rate their mode such as selecting the smiley which
                represents how they feel, such as:
              </li>
              <li>ask them if anything was annoying.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How can you make it better for your users ( people with learning
              and cognitive disabilities)
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>You can analyze the data collected above</li>
              <li>
                ask them how they feel about the system and if anything was
                annoying.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              If the user if failing blame the designer and not the user. Such
              as “ it is so helpful that you are doing this because our
              designers are not very good, or are always playing computer games
              so they think everyone is good at this stuff” or “you are really
              helping us make this useable by real people and not just
              engineers” . Stop the process if users are getting distressed
              despite this.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          As a short overview, usability could be measured based on efficacy,
          efficiency and satisfaction. This can be done by measuring or
          tracking:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>successes and noting any errors to measure efficacy,</li>
          <li>
            time taken per task to measure efficiency, note that the relative
            time between tasks is often more useful than absolute numbers. and
          </li>
          <li>user’s mood and comments to measure satisfaction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At the end of the evaluation you should be able to answer:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>What prevents the user from completing a task?</li>
          <li>
            What creates confusion? When and why do they misinterpret the
            interface?
          </li>
          <li>What produces an error and an incorrect action?</li>
          <li>When does the user get frustrated or upset</li>
          <li>
            When does the user misunderstand navigation, menus and controls?
          </li>
          <li>How can these problems be avoided?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note you will need to get informed consent from the tester before
          testing. Explain what they will be doing and why it is helping you. If
          there are any risks they need to be explained and understood. If your
          tester has a guardian you should get informed consent from both the
          tester and their guardian. Make sure potential participants are aware
          they can withdraw from the testing situation at any time and that
          their comments will be anonymised before being used in any report.

      <p>
        To help web content providers meet the needs of people with cognitive
        and learning disabilities we have identified the following objectives:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Design so that as many users as possible understand the site and
              know how to use it. </strong>This often involves using things that are clear and familiar to the
            user so that they do not have to learn new symbols, terms or design
            patterns. Personalization and good use of semantics can help make
            the symbols and design as familiar to the user as possible. People
            with cognitive disabilities rely upon predictable behavior in
            digital content. For example, many websites do not follow the
            standard convention for hyperlinks: blue = unvisited; purple =
            visited; and underlined. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme1">design guide</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Help the user find what they need. </strong>Navigating the
            system should be easy. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme2">design guide for navigation</a>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use clear and understandable content</strong> This includes
            clear text, clear images, speech, and easy to understand video. See
            the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme3">design guide for understandable content.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Prevent the user from making mistakes and make it easy to correct
              mistakes when they do occur.</strong>
            A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but
            when they do occur the user should know how to correct them, without
            having to render other data or start from the beginning. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme4">design guide for errors.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Help the user focus and restore context if attention is
              lost.</strong>
            Items like breadcrumbs can help orientate the user and help the user
            restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable
            can also help the user undo mistakes.) See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme5">design guide for focus.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Minimize the cognitive skills required to use the content and
              avoid barriers</strong>
            that stop people with cognitive disabilities from using content,
            such as hard to use security mechanisms. When possible, provide more
            accessible options. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme6">design guide for barriers.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Provide help and support.</strong> Graphics, summaries of
            long documents, adding icons to headings and links are all examples
            of extra help and support. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme7">design guide for support.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Feedback is usable by everyone.</strong> If users have
            difficulty sending feedback then you will not know if they are able
            to use the content or when they are experiencing problems.
            Therefore, it is essential that all the feedback mechanisms are
            tested by people with cognitive disabilities. See the
            <a href="../requirements/index.html#theme8">design guide for feedback.</a>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Note that most of the design patterns in the guide were originally
        created as recommendations for WCAG, the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/cognitive-a11y-tf/wiki/SC_To_Do_list">full list of potential requirements</a>

        <p><strong>Example recommendations for policies:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A policy for critical services might include any item with a high or
            medium level need
          </li>
          <li>A policy for emergency services might include all items</li>
          <li>
            A policy for legislation for wide adoption for all web sites might
            include any item that are testable, does not require human testing
            and have a high user need level.
          </li>
          <li>
            A policy for legislation for content needed in the workplace might
            include any item that are testable, and have a high or medium level
            user need level.

        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The following are example scenarios that may be included in a

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Critical services - such as water, health care, phone and internet
            services, government services
          </li>
          <li>Emergency services - such as police, fire, etc</li>
          <li>Content needed in the workplace, including professional sites</li>
          <li>
            Content that helps autonomy such as apps and interfaces to run home

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The following are example user considerations:</strong></p>
        <ul>

          <li>Autonomy and savings in care-giving</li>
          <li>
            Cost associated with people leaving the work place earlier than

        <p><strong>Other considerations include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Does this item require user testing to conform, and is this too

      <p>
        Making websites and applications that are friendly for people with
        cognitive impairments affects every part of design and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally accessibility has focused on the making the user interface
        usable for people with sensory and physical impairments in vision,
        hearing and/or mobility. Some accessibility features also help people
        with cognitive impairments, but often the issues that help people with
        cognitive impairments are about context, language, usability, and other
        more general factors that impact everyone to some degree. As a result
        they do not fit well into traditional accessibility standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document aims to provide guidance on how to make websites and
        applications that are friendly for people with cognitive impairments by
        providing guidance for your designs and design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Design Guide is Organised into design Objectives, each of which is
        a 'theme' for design that is inclusive of Cognitive Accessibility. Each
        Objective also includes user stories which outline user requirements.
        Finally, the Objective contains a number of detailed Design Patterns
        which describe steps that can be taken to make an improvement to
        cognitive accessibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding the Objectives, user stories and Patterns will help you
        create content that is more accessible to users with cognitive and
        learning disabilities. Please see the section on user testing for
        guidance on how to perform COGA user testing.

          Please note this document is not the final draft. We are still working
          on harmonizing the content and the internal consistency of the terms
          and style. The task force also intends to redo the tables to make them
          consistent with the design patterns (such as in 5.1 and 6.1). In
          addition, design patterns 2.8, 2.9, 2.6 and 2.10 2.13 and 5.3 and 5.6
          need to be checked for overlap. In addition we are exploring the

        To be able to use a site or application, people need to know what all
        controls and element are on your page and how to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not everyone finds learning new things easy, and not everyone can
        remember new designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more people need to figure things out, the less people can use your
        site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users cannot easily learn new design metaphors, or remember things
        they learned, such as users with mild cognitive impairment or dementia.
        Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to find what
        they need, work out what the items do and how to use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users can be overwhelmed by too many options, or too much
        information. If the individual's reading is slow, then too much
        information mixed together will make it difficult or impossible to use
        the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using familiar design, familiar terms and familiar symbols are key to
        being able to use the web for users who will struggle to remember new
        symbols and design. Users need the following to be familiar:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Element location: Place elements in expected locations. For example,
          people may look for the search on the top right hand corner of a page.
          If it is somewhere else it will be hard to find.
        </li>
        <li>
          Symbols: Use familiar symbols. For example, people may look for a
          question mark for help. If you use a different symbol fewer people
          will find help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Text: Use familiar terms. For example, some people have a limited
          vocabulary. Uncommon terms may cause them difficulty.
        </li>
        <li>Getting help: Always make it easy to find the help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Personalization can be extremely useful for designers who want to offer
        familiarity and flexibility. Familiarity helpsusers with cognitive and
        learning disabilities but is often based on the needs of the individual
        user. Personalization allows users to customize their interface, which
        is important as what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to
        another.

        <p>
          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          do an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Test for the following but set up the tests so that the user
          demonstrates their knowledge and understanding rather than answers a
          simple question::
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Does the user know what the page is about?</li>
          <li>Does the user know what actions they can take on a page?</li>
          <li>
            Does the user know where they are in a website, an application or a
            multi-step process?
          </li>
          <li>Can the user easily find the different sections of content?</li>
          <li>
            Identify the different activities that the user may want to complete
            on the page:
            <ul>
              <li>Can they achieve the activities without asking for help?</li>
              <li>
                Does the user make errors trying to achieve the activities?
              </li>

            Disorder.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example,someone with mild dementia is using online shopping.
            They get distracted and then when they look at the screen again they
            have forgotten what they were doing. A clear heading at the top of
            each page shows clearly
            <strong>what the page is about and what they are doing</strong>.

            who loses focus or gets distracted reorient to their current
            activity without reading a great deal of content or restarting.
            Providing information about the steps that need to be completed
            ensures that a user who may find a process difficult to complete can
            determine if they can successfully finish.

              someone with a learning disability is not sure if this application

            Visual of grouping of information is based on the psychological
            principle of
            <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001002859290014S">Common Regions</a>. It has been found that the grouping information using a border or
            color shading makes it easier for people to identify groups, even if
            the content of the group is not similar.
          </p>

            These graphical indicators allow people to identify structure and
            information types without reading text or have problems
            distinguishing groups of information. Using the graphical indicators
            consistently to indicate similar types of items aids with navigating
            content and reduces the cognitive load.

          <p>
            People who have difficulty with recognizing or comprehending written
            language, having difficulties with concentration or memory can find
            it easier to process graphical cues.
          </p>
          <p>
            People on the autism spectrum are more likely to identify graphical
            indicators and the use of color for grouping content than other
            approaches.

            Graphical indicators should also be presented programmatically to

            It is also important the graphical indicators do not clutter the
            interface and are used consistently as that can add an additional

          <p>
            Providing shorter logical segments allows a person to find and
            review a specific topic. If that person loses concentration or steps
            away, clear segmentation allows them to easily find their place in
            the material and start again. This is especially important for
            educational style content where review is often necessary.

            Chunking media also allows for each segment to be given a unique URL

        <p>
          Make the purpose of each section clear. Often this involves providing
          clear headings that briefly defines the purpose of each section.
          Content that is not directly relevant to the main purpose of a page
          should be distinctly separated and programmatically determinable.
        </p>
        <section id="how-it-helps-3">
          <h5 id="a-2-7-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">A.2.7.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-3"></a></h5>
          <p>
            Each page or section of content should be organized and marked so
            that its purpose is obvious. This might be through the use of
            headings or labels or even a pyramid style of writing or even non
            textual markers (with suitable alternatives). A clear organization
            of content into pages and sections with obvious purpose allows users
            to more easily locate relevant sections and to be confident that
            those they read in detail will match their purposes. There will also
            be no need to read all the content in case something important is
            missed. For example, Ads that appear in-line in a section of content
            are rarely related to the purpose of a section and can be placed in
            a separate delimited section. Sometimes symbols (with alt text) can
            be used to make the sections purpose clear.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some examples of how this will help people:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A person with memory issues may need a clear heading structure to
              stay focused.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with an attention disability gets distracted and then
              needs to pick up where they left off and headings help
            </li>
            <li>
              A slow reader may depend on a heading structure to find important
              information they need without forcing them to read the whole
              document.
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with dementia loses focus and then can not remember what
              they were doing
            </li>
            <li>
              Someone with a learning disability is not sure if this application
              has too many steps and if they will manage. By seeing they are
              halfway though they can gauge if they can cope with the entire
              process.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with
            interesting stories about activities and important announcements.
            Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the
            newsletter has a good heading structure, it will be easier for a
            parent who is a slow reader to find the important announcements
            about early school dismissal. Without a good heading structure, the
            important early dismissal information can be easily missed.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The heading structure should create an outline of the document
              that could serve as an abstract of the whole document.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heading structure makes the content easier to scan and find more
              detailed information that a person needs at a moment.

        <p>Use a clear design for controls by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Using a common style on controls (for example: links being
            underlined);
          </li>
          <li>
            Using common design pattern on links and controls (for example:
            clicking on a link takes you to the page);
          </li>
          <li>
            Making all the borders of controls clear other than textual links
            (for example: a help icon has a border);
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensuring items that are not clickable do not look like links or
            controls.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          When this is not possible, provide instructions that explain their
          use. Instructions should be on the same page or one click away and
          written in plain language.

          <p>
            Using common style and design pattern on controls makes it easier to
            recognize and understand how to use it. Controls are parts of web
            pages that do something, e.g. a link, button, checkbox. The goal of
            these controls is to have someone use them. For example, an older
            user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes longer to learn new
            designs. They go to an eCommerce site has boxes around the headers
            (such as "womens" or "sale") and simple large text for the "add to
            cart" button. They click on the headings and not on the add to cart.
            After a few failures they assume they cannot manage it and leave the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some users have trouble when controls have a different look, color
            or shape than they have used before. For example, when links do not
            have underlines and blue or purple text (even if this appears with
            focus) some users will not know there is a link.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have difficulty with memory, it can be harder to use unique
            controls. It may be slower to find them on the page. And even if
            they work just a little differently than similar ones, some may need
            to relearn how to use them each time they need to use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using typical controls on the page will help people know how to use
            them. When using more unique controls, include easy to follow
            instructions and make them easy to find. Regardless of how a user
            uses the page (vision, auditory, voice input) it should be easy to
            identify, understand and use the controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are designing a new control, make them easy to identify (I
            know they are there), understand (I know what they do), and use (I
            know how to use them). Test with people with different cognitive and
            learning disabilities. Use a simple style or have easy to follow
            instructions that explain their use.

          <p><strong>Good Examples</strong>:</p>
          <p>
            Links with an underline and/or blue text color (or purple for
            already visited links), or both clearly identify links. Once a color
            is selected to be the primary link text color, other text on the
            page does not use this.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Poor Examples</strong></p>
          <p>
            Links without an underline or usual blue text color (or purple for
            already visited links), even those that become clear when they
            receive focus are more difficult to use. Some users may not know
            they are there.

              Sometimes the structure and relationships can be made clear

          <p>
            Controls that affect only one section of a page can be confusing.
            Having a border around the controls and the relevant page section is
            helpful. If the controls cannot be next to the area they affect,
            check with user testing that the users find all the page
            relationships clear and immediately know how to use the controls.

            For example, consider someone with dementia trying to work out which
            scrollbar to use if there are more than one embedded in scrollable
            regions. When users try the wrong scrollbar, they do not get the
            effect they desire. Many users will look again at the content, try
            and work out what they are supposed to do, and discover the correct
            scrollbar. However, many people with cognitive disabilities will not
            be able to work out what they did incorrectly. Others will feel
            cognitive overload, and will give up before they try. They may
            assume the application is broken, or that it is just too complicated
            for them. For all of these users, the application will not be

            This helps people with cognitive disabilities that impact problem
            solving skills, those that get overwhelmed when presented with a lot
            of text, and those with difficulties with more complicated tasks.
            This can include some individuals with early stages of dementia,
            people who have had a concussion or a stroke, people with
            intellectual disabilities, and others. Those impacted may not
            complete tasks, miss key information, and not return to pages that
            are complicated to use and understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            By creating clear layouts, with easy to use controls, a greater
            number of individuals can focus on the task instead of spending time
            figuring out how to use the controls and information. They easily
            find key information, and are more likely to return to the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, do not have two scroll bars close together. Some users
            may find it difficult to determine which one to use with a
            particular section of content. Instead, use clear visual layout and
            placement of the scroll bars, break the content into two separate
            pages, or consider removing unnecessary information from the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people with disabilities need a clear layout to help them know
            how to use the information. When structure and relationships are
            unclear, end users may need to experiment with different layouts and
            structures until they work out how to use them. However, people with
            cognitive disabilities may not be able to do so, and may not be able
            to use the content or application.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example 1: </strong>A website has 2 scroll bars, each
            operates a different section. When users try the wrong scroll bar,
            they do not get the effect they desire. Many users will look again
            at the content; try and work out what they are supposed to do; and
            discover the correct scroll bar. However, many people with cognitive
            disabilities will not be able to work out what they did incorrectly.
            Others will feel cognitive overload, and will give up before they
            try. They may assume the application is broken, or that it is just
            too complicated for them. For all of these users, the application
            will not be usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example 2: </strong>Chunks of content run into each other
            with a "flat design". Whereas some users can work out which chunks
            belong together, many users with cognitive disabilities will find it
            challenging or impossible. Thus, all the benefits of chunking
            content are lost.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Using Summary Content</strong> - Placing an outline of
              content at the top of the page, and/or key information and
              elements “above the fold” will provide greater access. For
              example, in an email application, the send button should be near
              the top so it is easy to find and use;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Separating Content</strong> - White space, call outs, and
              other methods should be used in addition to headings to help
              define sections of content. This organizes the information on the
              page so it is easier to determine layout and find specific
              information;
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Separating Interactive Elements </strong>- Place
              interactive elements like scroll bars and buttons close to the
              content they can impact. Also, keep interactive elements further
              from content to which they do not apply. This makes it easier to
              identify which elements will impact each section of content.
            </li>

              Users may not be easily able to find features that do not display
              in their initial view of the page (items “under the fold”). For
              example, in an email application, the send button being located
              under the email’s body text;
            </li>
            <li>
              Dense text, with little white space, no call outs, and a lack of

        <p>
          It is easy to know that sub-menu items are there and how to get to
          them. Users should be able to easily identify:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>That there are sub-menus and;</li>
          <li>How to reach sub-menu items.</li>

          <p>
            When opening a web page for the first time, the sub-menus are
            typically collapsed and their design may make it difficult to even
            know that they are there. Some users with cognitive disabilities may
            not guess that they are present, or after seeing one expand by
            accident, may not generalize that this structure may be present for
            other items in a menu. Making it easy to notice that there are
            sub-menu items ensures the user can use this part of your site. An
            example is a menu without any visual indication that there are
            sub-menu items.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are times where how to open the sub-menu item may not be easy
            for some with cognitive disabilities. If the control to expand a
            menu item relies on a particular gesture or way of rolling over the
            area with a mouse, for example, the end user may not figure out how
            to expand the sub-menu and may abandon the task. An example would be
            a menu that expands only after moving the mouse over a particular
            side of the menu text.

              All menu items with sub-menu items, when accessed with a mouse

              the menu requires the interaction, or a separate control (e.g. a

            Confusion can occur when visual hierarchy of information is not
            immediately apparent to the user. Distinction between levels in
            content hierarchy may be difficult to understand or perceive due to
            minimal type size or type weight differences or color differences
            that are not easily perceived or understood. Furthermore hierarchy
            solely dependent on small unique design elements may create
            confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example a drop down accordion menu of additional sub-menu items
            may not be viewable without understanding it needs to be clicked (or
            ‘rolled over’) as indicated by a small unique design element.

          <p>
            Small design elements that indicate sub-menu items will be presented
            that aren’t always readily apparent or meaningful to the user and
            not universally adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples include a chevron (triangle). In different designs it can
            be either left facing right facing, up facing or down facing
            depending on state and the unique design standard affecting
            interpretation of state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confusion can occur when a right facing chevron can indicate that
            more information will be presented on the current page when clicked
            or it may mean that information is currently being presented, or it
            may indicate that it takes the user to a new page. Consistent and
            general best practices should be used to make it understandable to
            the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore a series of these nested elements on a long page can
            create visual hierarchy confusion if dependent solely on
            interpretation of design elements.

            Many users, such as those with mild cognitive impairment or
            dementia, cannot easily learn and remember new design metaphors.
            Without these skills, it can be much harder or impossible to locate
            desired items to interact with, and to know what interactions may
            do. Users can feel lost or overwhelmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because common design elements are repeated often over a long period
            of use across many sites, users are more likely to recognize the
            interactions needed.

          <p>Common design elements, affordances and patterns include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Links that look like links and buttons look and act like buttons:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For example, underline links with a standard style throughout
                  a page;
                </li>

              Uses common design patterns, such as are documented in the ARIA
              authoring best practices or are used in the most popular sites:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Very common navigation design patterns and common icons;

                <li>
                  A platform specific user interface design for navigation
                  mechanisms and icons;
                </li>
                <li>
                  An adaptive user interface design that can be personalized

              Create a standard Visual Hierarchy - Place elements where the user

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Putting the search in the top right hand corner in a website;
                </li>
                <li>
                  The link to the home page is in the top left hand corner;

            When deciding pages, select standard components that look and behave
            the way users expect. Use standard conventions for layout such as
            the home link in the upper left corner, navigation at the top,
            search in the upper right, etc. and create an obvious visual
            hierarchy in the page.

          <p>
            Those with difficulty understanding how to interact with information
            need to use cues like color, layout and other visual information to
            help them know where to look, what they should do and how they
            should complete that task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an older user with age appropriate forgetfulness takes
            a long time to learn new designs. When they come to a site, the
            first page takes time to understand, but then they know what to do
            on the next page. If the next page is different from the first and
            also difficult to learn, they become tired and make more mistakes,
            as they move to a third page the cognitive load becomes too much and
            they cannot complete the task. This pattern helps by:
          </p>

            <li>

              building confidence;

              Headings with the same structural level have the same font and

            <li>
              Structure of content and style of presenting information should be

            People who have language comprehension difficulties who may be able
            to mechanically read but not understand the content or those who
            have learning and/or reading difficulties may rely on symbols to
            understand content and navigate to content they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with aphasia, has the intellectual ability to
            understand concepts, but struggles with language. They may be
            dependent on the use of symbols to browse pages for information.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can also help the elderly population who can find cluttered pages
            with dense text hard to read on a screen. Clear symbols and images
            that act as signposts to the text content can be very helpful.

          <p>
            People with low executive function, impaired memory, and other
            cognitive and learning disabilities may not be able to find features
            that require the use of the scroll bar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users who are unfamiliar with the page (or common design patterns)
            rely on prominent visual styling aids to locate important
            information.

          <p>
            The amount of page visible before scrolling is dependent on a wide
            range of factors such as physical device size, resolution, pixel
            density and device setup.
          </p>
          <p>
            The size of the visible region will be site specific. Where
            possible, use site statistics to understand the technology users are
            using and keep this in mind when designing the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an elementary school publishes a weekly newsletter with
            interesting stories about activities and important announcements.
            Important announcements include early school dismissal. If the
            newsletter has a good heading structure, it will be easier for a
            parent who is a slow reader to find the important announcements
            about early school dismissal. This important information about early
            dismissal information can be easily missed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user is writing a comment, but the send button
            is not visible when the view focuses on the text area. As a result
            she cannot see how to send her feedback. The company will then not
            receive any feedback from groups who are not able to find the
            feedback button.

          <p>
            Make it easy to find the most important things on the page. Identify
            key content and its placement early in the design process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Space at the top of the document is most likely to be visible to
            users without scrolling. Placing key content at the top of the page
            will give the best experience to the widest range of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider the most constrained user experience first (e.g., a 240px
            wide mobile phone) and then design upwards from there in order to
            encounter the widest range of scenarios.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conducting user testing can identify common user cases and barriers.
            Adopting responsive development practices can improve the
            flexibility of the page to a range of different devices and
            stations.

          <p>
            Having a search capability allows users to find the content they
            need even if they cannot manage to find content via the site menus
            or other browsing mechanisms. A user can learn how to use search and
            reuse that skill on many sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            User studies have shown the aging population tend to rely on search
            to locate information rather than navigating menus or surfing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Menu systems, and most site navigation require the user to
            understand the categories of the pages that the content provider has
            created for general use. Users with impaired executive function may
            be unable to identify the correct categories.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, users know the correct category via memory, rather
            than logic. For example, most users remember that the print function
            is often found under the file menu. Users with impaired memory may
            not be able to find these menu items based on recall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Navigating a site and going to many pages to look for content, is
            also difficult for people with impaired short-term memory or for
            people who are easily distracted, as they may lose focus and forget
            what they are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search is most useful when it corrects misspellings, finds
            appropriate or related content or provides suggested auto-corrected
            versions of the search terms that the user can choose from.

        <p>
          The standard back button is the best way to do this as it is familiar
          to the user and this might be the way they will try first.
        </p>
        <p>The user should never lose their work if they press back.</p>

          <p>
            This helps prevent users from making mistakes and makes it easy to
            correct mistakes when they happen.
          </p>
          <p>Examples of mistakes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Touching a control by accident;</li>
            <li>Opening a new link by accident;</li>
            <li>Closing a window that you intended to keep open.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If a person easily makes mistakes or makes them often, it is
            important that they can go back and make changes without having
            their work or previous choices deleted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user is watching a video. They try to increase the
            volume but touch a different link instead. A new video now loads.
            The user can press the back button and return to the video they were
            watching before. They now know they can try and increase the volume
            and if they make a mistake, they can easily go back and try again.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, the back button did not worked as expected, but
            took them somewhere else (such as the home page). When they try to
            change the volume or add a comment they often lose the video they
            were watching and cannot find the way to get back to it. They now
            feel they cannot use any of the features of the website in case they
            lose their main content again. They do not use larger screen, change
            the volume, or leave comments.
          </p>
          <p>
            In forms, each time the user has to re-enter data there is a new
            chance for mistakes to occur. Entering and re-entering data can be
            stressful and tiring from some people with learning and cognitive
            disabilities. This increases the likelihood of mistakes and may make
            it impossible to submit correct data and complete the intended task.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those with anxiety, memory challenges, and difficulty following
            directions, the ability to go back and review information they have
            entered is very important. For example, for some people the task of
            following directions and reviewing their answers works best as two
            separate tasks. Being able to enter information with their focus
            being on following the directions, and later going back to review
            their answers, helps them be more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the user has an opportunity to go back and review the data they
            entered, even if submitted by mistake, it is easier to correct the
            information.

            Use common and clear words. Look at the most common 1500 words or
            phrases. These are the terms that people with severe language
            impairments are most likely to know.
          </li>
          <li>Remove unnecessary words</li>
          <li>
            Do not invent new words or give words new meanings in your
            application. Do not expect people to learn new meanings for words
            just to use your content. If you must make a new terms make sure the
            user has access to an explanation within one click or event.

            Start by putting clear words on headings labels, navigational
            elements, instructions, and error messages. This will increase the
            usability a lot without taking so long.

            This benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with language impairments often have a reduced vocabulary and
            learning new terms is a very slow difficult process. For other
            groups, such as people living with dementia, learning new terms is
            not realistic or possible. Using uncommon words, that they do not
            already know, will make the content understandable and unusable.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, someone with mild dementia is trying to turn on an ICT
            heating and air conditioning unit. The menu item for selecting heat
            or air conditioning is labeled "mode". The user cannot use the whole
            unit because of this one term. This has caused emergencies such as
            hypothermia.

        <p>
          Use the tense and the voice is easiest to understand. In English this
          is usually the present tense and active voice. Speak directly to the
          user, and use the simplest form of verbs.

          <p>
            This benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory. For example, more people
            will understand “press the on button” (present tense and active
            voice) then “the on button should be pressed”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Active voice makes it clear who is supposed to do what. For example
            “It must be done.” (passive voice) does not say who has to do what.
            “You must do it.” is active voice and is more clear.

            <li>
              In languages where present tense and active voice do not exist, or

          Use literal and concrete language. When possible, use concrete terms

            Many people do not understand non literal content. For example, a

            and similes. Sometime instructions have jokes and similes to make
            their content more friendly. However this confuses the programmer
            who now cannot do her job as needed.

          <p>
            The meaning must still be completely clear when non literal text is

            This benefits many people including those with language impairments,
            learning disabilities or a poor memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a person with a low working memory cannot hold onto
            many pieces of information at the same time. If they need to
            remember what they are doing, divide the steps and track what they
            have done they are much more likely to make mistakes. When
            instructions are clearly separated and clearly laid they can follow
            them without making mistakes.

              <strong>How can I avoid writing a sentence with more than one point? </strong>Sentences that have more than one point usually have more than

            <li>
              <strong>Can a long sentence ever be clearer than two short sentences? </strong>Double-check if a long sentence is clearer than two short
              sentences. Do usability testing to see if people with cognitive

          <p><strong>Failure Example </strong></p>

            DOTD Issues Winter Weather Travel Advisory for Calgary. With the
            possibility of snow and rain in the forecast throughout the holiday
            weekend, the Department of Transportation and Development (DOTD)
            announced that department staff is prepared to deal with winter
            weather. Maintenance forces will be on standby to apply sand and
            salt over any affected bridges and roadways, to remove fallen trees
            from the roadway, and to close any roads as needed. Interim
            Secretary Jane Doe urges motorists to take the threat of winter
            weather seriously. "In the event of adverse weather conditions, the
            department will strive to maintain access to highways and
            interstates; however, we encourage the motoring public to avoid
            traveling during snow and ice, if at all possible," said Doe. During
            winter weather conditions, the best thing motorists can do is drive
            slowly and carefully, and avoid driving while distracted. Always
            allow for extra driving time, reduce speeds when visibility is low,
            and make sure there is plenty of room between vehicles. Also, look
            out for black ice, which can form on bridges, overpasses, off- ramps
            and in shady spots. As always, DOTD reminds motorists to buckle up
            and refrain from drinking and driving. Citizens can get the latest
            updates on real-time traffic and road conditions by using the
            Traveler Information System simply by dialing ### from their
            telephone and saying the route or region about which they are
            seeking information. Travelers can also access this information by
            visiting the Traveler Information Website. Motorists can also obtain
            information regarding road closures by contacting DOTD’s Customer
            Service Center at (1-###-###-####). The center is open 7:30 a.m.- 5
            p.m. Monday through Friday.

          <p>
            White space (also called negative space or the background color)
            reduces clutter and provides definition to content. This gives the
            viewer a clear overview of a web page. It is used by designers to
            enhance text and the position of objects on a page.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use of white space aids navigation through a page and helps people
            read it. It can help the user find important elements on a page. For
            those with cognitive impairments, it has been shown to ease reading
            difficulties and improves understanding of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Make sure the user can also adjust the amount of white space around
            objects and text via a web extension or user setting. This supports
            the ability to identify important elements in the content of a web
            page.

            paragraphs and blocks of text.

          <p>
            Allow for the ability to easily adjust white space around objects

            For some readers, decoding words, numbers and symbols is not an
            automatic task and can be demanding on working memory and executive
            functions. If they find content too demanding they are at risk of
            losing its meaning and the overall context of the message that is
            being conveyed. Some users may use assistive technology or
            personalization tools to reduce the cognitive demands of decoding
            content. An example would be text-to-speech that reads aloud content
            allowing for the use of auditory and visual channels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users should not need to be distracted from their task in order to
            decipher letters, numbers, and words. They should be able to focus
            on understanding the meaning of the content, especially when they
            are using assistive technology or personalizing content. It is
            important that the content is created with these adaptations in
            mind, to ensure that all users gain the experience you want them to
            achieve. Content creators should ensure that information is provided
            in a way that can be read accurately by assistive technology. It may
            have to be personalized to suit certain users, but this can be
            achieved when all the elements are accessible.

            <strong>Use punctuation correctly</strong> for the language you are
            writing in, as it will affect how the stress and intonation (known
            as prosody) patterns from the text are heard, when converted into
            speech. For example, in English, commas and semicolons will result
            in a short pause in the speech, whereas a hyphen – will generally be
            ignored. Question marks, exclamation marks and speech marks can
            result in changes in intonation, such as a rise in the pitch of the
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Avoid the use of Roman Numerals and unfamiliar symbols</strong>
            in text were possible. These can confuse readers and are likely to
            be read incorrectly by text-to-speech tools. If these symbols are
            necessary then ensure they are marked up correctly, using techniques
            such as MathML and abbreviation expansions to provide additional
            support. Roman Numerals should be presented in upper case if used in
            isolation as they are likely to be read as individual letters
          </p>

            Be aware that long numbers may be read as single digits or phrased
            as a single number. This is a particular problem for phone numbers
            or zip codes. While it is difficult to control exactly how these
            numbers are read aloud, content creators can help by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Displaying the content of the number and using HTML semantics to
              ensure users and assistive technologies are aware of the number’s
              purpose. In addition the following recommendations can assist with
              improving text-to-speech rendering:
            </li>
            <li>
              For phone numbers, using the correct layout for the locality of
              the phone number and ensure users can select the whole phone
              number (including area code), so that text-to-speech voices can
              recognize the format and phrase it correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
              For Zip / Postal codes, including state or address information
              close to the number so that speech voices can expand known
              abbreviations (such as state names) and listeners can perceive the
              context.
            </li>
            <li>
              When writing long numbers, considering what separators will be
              familiar to your readers and how it will be read aloud. In
              general, English speaking countries will use commas between
              thousands and a period as the decimal separator whereas German and
              other European countries do the opposite. For example, 1,245 would
              represent one thousand two hundred and forty five in English, but
              one point two four five in German. Text-to-speech output will
              assume the separators are being used in the format of the language
              of its voice. If this does not match the content then listeners
              can become easily confused. While replacing thousand separators
              with a space has become a common convention to avoid confusion, it
              leads to difficulties with text-to-speech with long numbers being
              read out in a disjointed fashion. For example, 120 034 943 can be
              read as one hundred and twenty, zero three four, nine hundred and
              forty three.

          <p>
            Consider how you write dates, because once again the text-to-speech
            will use the format associated with the language of the voice. A
            date such as 04/03/2019 will be read as “April 3rd 2019” by a US
            English voice and “4th of March 2019” by a British English voice.
            Writing out the month in words can avoid confusion.

            Making the summary easy to understand helps many people to quickly

            In this case, a very high level outline in a few sentences or bullet
            points is most effective. Abstracts and executive summaries are
            usually much longer and more detailed as they are designed to
            summarize the entire document.

          <p>Not all people can understand numbers and numerical concepts.</p>
          <p>
            For example, some people have dyscalculia, a learning disability
            specifically-related to mathematics. People with dyscalculia have
            significant problems with numbers and mathematical concepts, but
            often have a normal or above-normal IQ.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with dyscalculia may have difficulty processing
            temperature data when presented only in a numeric format. However,
            if non-numeric alternatives are provided (cold, warm, hot etc.) then
            they are able to understand the content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numeracy issues can occur due to a range of disabilities, the most
            severe being the inability to read or understand numbers. Other
            people have challenges with any calculations such as relative sizes
            or times. When reading measurement an individual with cognitive
            impairment may understand the concept of 90cms as a length but find
            it hard to cope with the fact that 0.9m and 900mm are the same
            length.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a train schedule has a long list of relative times that
            they train leaves for different zones on the hour. The user can not
            calculate when the next train leaves from their location.

        A good design and use of scripts will make errors less likely, but when

        Completing forms and similar tasks is often overwhelming for most users
        with cognitive and learning disabilities. This includes relatively minor
        learning disabilities, such as Dyslexia, or attention related
        disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users with learning disabilities cannot remember numbers, such as
        those for their post/zip code, Social Security, or credit card. Many
        users even need to check their phone numbers. This makes entering
        information slow, and they may need to leave their desks or take breaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also many users have short term memory issues that can make copying text
        difficult or impossible. For example, if you can remember 7 letters in
        your head at the same time. They may be able to remember one or two.
        This makes them much more likely to make mistakes copying as it requires
        you to remember the numbers or letter accurately.

          Choose a form design that reduces the chance that the user will make a
          mistake. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a text field, accept as many formats as possible. For example
            accept different formats of phone numbers and correct
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#input-errordef">Input errors</a>
            automatically;
          </li>
          <li>Use an interface were only valid input can be selected;</li>
          <li>Use autocomplete and personalization of form controls;</li>
          <li>Accept voice prompts when supported by the operating system;</li>
          <li>
            When possible input errors should be automatic corrected (where the
            correction is reliable);
          </li>
          <li>
            If suggestions for corrections are known, the suggestions are
            provided to the user.
          </li>
        </ul>

          <p>
            People with cognitive or learning disabilities and aging users often
            abandon tasks and believe they cannot complete them if they receive
            too many errors. Error messages may be confusing. Correcting errors
            is often difficult and frustrating for the user. Many users give up
            when they get successive errors
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, while registering for an online banking account a form
            requires the input of the user's birthdate. The required input
            format is xx/xx/xxxx with a leading zero for single digits. If a
            single input field with no input correction is presented, a user
            with a cognitive disability may enter 1/3/1996 thus triggering an
            error notification. It may not be clear to the user that the
            required format is 01/03/1996 even if an example for instance,
            xx/xx/xxxx, is shown below the input field or in the error
            notification.
          </p>
          <p>
            However a well-designed form will make it easier to fill in the
            information and prevent the user from making mistakes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Minimizing user generated errors by automatically correcting them
            will also minimize error notifications. Error notifications may be
            distracting taking focus away from tasks and task completion.

          Always allow the user to check their work and correct any mistakes.
          Once the user has fixed their mistake it should be easy to get back to
          the place they were at without redoing additional steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          For financial transactions and important information: Allow the user
          to easily cancel the transactions and provide clear information and
          simple instructions for important information including the amount of
          time the user has to cancel a transaction.

          <h5 id="a-5-4-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">A.5.4.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-26"></a></h5>
          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning impairments make many more
            mistakes in filling out forms than the general population. When
            mistakes cannot be easily corrected they cannot complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            This helps people with cognitive disabilities for safely using forms
            and reduces the consequences that are the result of a mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a memory impairment may not remember that
            they have already added an item to their shopping cart and may add
            the item a second time. They may confused the dates when booking a
            trip, and many other mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential that people with cognitive impairments have the
            opportunity to check their work AND can fix their mistakes easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For people with cognitive disabilities, mistakes being theoretically
            reversible is not enough. Often the process of reversing a
            transaction is too complex for them to manage without help. They may
            not have access to that help meaning they have to live with all the
            mistakes they have made. For example, when inputting credit card
            information incorrectly these mistakes can be devastating. In
            addition if the process of correcting mistakes is too difficult,
            users may give up, either losing the transaction or buying unwanted
            items because of the one required item.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect of this happening multiple times is devastating and can
            result in a large number of users with disabilities stopping to use
            the Internet for many tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing the user to change the number of items in the shopping cart
            at any time can significantly reduce the chances of these mistakes.
          </p>
          <p>
            A summary of the order, including product quantities and other costs
            before the final submission, gives the user the chance to identify
            any errors and make changes to the order. In this example given, a
            summary of the purchase helps the user see the error in quantity as
            well as a higher than expected order total.
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases a user may realize that a mistake has been made after
            the final submission of data. Simple language instructions on how to
            cancel transactions and helping the user understanding the amount of
            time the user has to cancel a transaction and makes them less
            susceptible to scams
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, a user with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity
            Disorder purchasing a travel ticket on a website may struggle with
            details and may have a low attention span. The successful completion
            of the order relies on the information provided at multiple steps in
            the process. An error due to lack of accuracy or attention to detail
            such as an incorrect street number or zip code in the billing
            address will result in the order not going though. If a summary is
            not provided before submitting the final order or is not clear the
            user may not understand the reason for the declined payment and give
            up on the order. The user may also give up if there is not an easy
            way to make correction, and all the order needs to be redone.

          <p>
            Forgiving form entry processes help prevent user errors up front.
            This reduces frustration and enhances the user’s autonomy and
            independence because they can avoid asking for help. This helps
            anybody with memory issues, people new to culture, and people on the
            autism spectrum who may miss cultural context.

          Avoid timeouts. When this is not possible, inform user of the amount

          <p>
            The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users
            with cognitive disabilities, as these users may require more time to
            read content or to perform functions, such as completing an online
            form.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the completion of an online process for reserving a hotel
            room and purchasing a plane ticket, a user with a cognitive
            impairment may become overwhelmed with the amount of instruction and
            data input required to complete the process. The user may not be
            able to complete the process in one sitting, and may need to take a
            break. Users should be able to leave a process without losing their
            current place within the process, and without losing data that have
            already been entered. If users cannot take a break and check their
            work, many will often be unable to complete a task correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            While making a purchase on an e-commerce Web site, a user with a
            cognitive disability may not remember required information (e.g., a
            phone number or a zip code) that may seem easy to remember for users
            without a cognitive impairment. Users with cognitive disabilities
            may need additional time to look up the information required to
            complete a transaction, without losing their place in the process,
            and without losing data that have already been entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            In another example, users’ cognitive skills may temporarily diminish
            as they get tired. They then must stop the task for that day, and
            continue it when they are feeling better, and when their reading or
            processing skills are back to their higher levels.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              A Web site uses a client-side time limit to help protect users who
              may step away from their computers. After a period of inactivity,
              the Web page asks if the user needs more time. If the user does
              not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout occurs. The user is able
              to request more time at least 10 times.
            </li>
            <li>
              A Web page has a section that automatically updates with the
              latest headlines in a rotating fashion. There is an interactive
              control that is easy to activate and is labeled with simple text.
              It allows the user to extend the length of time, between each
              update, to as much as ten times the default. The control can be
              operated by mouse, keyboard, or touch.
            </li>
            <li>
              A ticket-purchasing web site allows users two minutes to confirm
              purchase of selected seats, but warns users when their time is
              almost out. It allows users to extend this time limit at least 10
              times using a simple action, which is labeled with simple text,
              such as a button labeled "Extend time limit."
            </li>
            <li>
              In an auction, there is a time limit on the amount of time a user
              has to submit a bid. Because the time limit applies to all users
              who want to bid on an item, it would be unfair to extend the time
              limit for one user. Therefore, a time limit is required for this
              type of activity. No extension, adjustment, or deactivation of
              such a time limit is required by this design requirement.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This pattern helps people with a variety of disabilities including
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              People with physical disabilities, who often need more time to
              react, to type, and to complete activities. - People with low
              vision need more time to locate things on screen, and to read.
              People who are blind, and who use screen readers, may need more
              time to understand screen layouts, to find information, and to
              operate controls. People, who have cognitive or language
              limitations, need more time to read and to understand. People who
              are deaf, and who communicate in sign language, may need more time
              to read textual information (which may be a second language for
              some).
            </li>
            <li>
              In circumstances where a sign-language interpreter may be relating
              audio content to a user who is deaf, control over time limits is
              also important.
            </li>
            <li>
              People with reading disabilities, cognitive limitations, and
              learning disabilities, who may need more time to read or to
              comprehend information, can pause content to have additional time
              to read it.

            For situations where the absence of a timed event would
            significantly change the intended functionality of an application
            (e.g., an auction or another real-time event), it is important to
            ensure that users with disabilities are properly notified.
          </p>
          <p>
            A website only times out when sensitive information is given (such
            as the users credit card information). The sensitive information is
            asked for at the last stage of the process. The user is warned that
            once they give the credit card information they should complete the
            process quickly as the session can time out. After a period of
            inactivity, the Web page asks the user to press any key for more
            time. If the user does not respond within 120 seconds, a timeout
            occurs. However when the user comes back and logs-in again all the
            content is back.

          Making the result of each user action clear helps people with a
          variety of cognitive disabilities:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understand that their actions were processed (e.g., the click did
              something);
            </li>
            <li>Prevent uncertainty or doubt regarding the outcome;</li>
            <li>Remember what they just did.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with age appropriate forgetfulness, may have
            difficulty remembering how the interface worked. So when they press
            the send button that may not feel confident that the form was
            submitted. Feedback, such as a thank you message, will tell them and
            make them feel confident in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a multi-step task this feedback (user-action feedback) can
            also assist people, with attention or short-term cognitive
            disabilities remember what they are doing. For example, a user with
            early dementia may get distracted and then forget exactly where they
            were in the task. This user-action feedback helps re-orientate them.
            It also helps avoid them leaving a task by reminding them that they
            are in a process, and where in the process they currently are.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provide easily-recognizable success or failure feedback with every
            user action. When possible the feedback should use a consistent and
            familiar design patterns. For example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              After a step in a multi-step task is completed, breadcrumbs
              display a tick or a checkmark next to that step's name; and, if
              applicable, the title or the name of the next step is readily
              apparent.
            </li>
            <li>
              After a button is clicked, it should look depressed. (Note that if
              it is a toggle button, the state should also be programmatically
              determinable).
            </li>
            <li>
              After a form is submitted or an email message is sent, feedback
              communicating what just happened, such as "Your application was
              submitted, thank you" or "Your email message was sent" is
              provided.

          <p>
            Users with cognitive disabilities who have trouble with memory,
            attention to detail or reading comprehension may not be aware of
            charges unless they are explicitly noted at the start of a
            transaction task. Terms and conditions can be under a link but
            charges must be clearly displayed and available in plain language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clearly identifying charges at the start of a sale benefits all
            users. Those with cognitive disabilities will particularly benefit
            because some groups are less likely to have inferred or guessed the
            charges would be included. They may not know to look in other
            locations in the user flow or in another location, for example on
            the homepage, or on a rates page.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with impaired Executive Function or memory need to have all
            the consequences presented in an orderly form to be able to make an
            informed decision. When charges are not clear, the consent of the
            transaction is unclear.
          </p>
          <p>
            It also can take much longer for users with disabilities to go
            through the process of making a purchase. If a person has spent
            hours making an online purchase, it is much more difficult and
            upsetting to find out that they cannot afford it. They will often
            blame themselves for not understanding the price and may experience
            a loss of confidence. They may stop trusting themselves for
            day-to-day activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example a person with Executive Function challenges may be
            trying to order a plane ticket, and not realize that there are extra
            fees not quoted in the original price, such as taxes, international
            fees, baggage fees, etc. They may spend hours booking a holiday only
            to find that they can’t afford it. Alternatively, sometimes they end
            up purchasing something they cannot afford. And even if they have
            completed this process in the past, they are not able to bring their
            experience into future purchases to anticipate the final price. The
            result is the user loses confidence in their ability to
            independently purchase a holiday online, may have incurred a debt
            they are unable to pay, may not attempt again, or only with the help
            of a hired professional (e.g. travel agent or assistant).

          Ensure that changes of context, functionality, settings, route and

          <p>
            Any content, settings or functionality which changes unexpectedly,
            without user initiation can result in significant barriers for users
            with cognitive disabilities. Unexpected changes in any of these
            areas can result in loss of focus, anxiety, or confusion in
            understanding or using a user interface (such as menus, buttons and
            design components). Examples include but are not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Automatic launching of new windows or pop-ups;</li>
            <li>
              Submission of forms through mechanisms other than a button that is
              clearly labeled using simple language to submit the form;
            </li>
            <li>Rerouting automatically by a GPS;</li>
            <li>Changing the direction of a map in a GPS.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user may not have a sense of direction or know their
            left and right. Before using a GPS they may study the route so that
            they know approximately what they are doing and can augment the
            directions of the GPS with their own context, using the GPS for
            cues. The GPS automatically reroutes them because of a small traffic
            delay. They become completely lost and disorientated and can no
            longer use the application.
          </p>
          <p>
            This give users with cognitive disabilities more control over how
            Websites and applications behave and display information giving them
            the opportunity to make choices that enable them to use the content
            and complete the task.

          <p>
            It is vital that users stay safe on the Internet. Information which
            suggests a user has Dementia or an intellectual disability allows
            predatory companies and individuals to target that user for scams or
            other risky activity. For example, a predatory company could send
            requests for money, saying “you haven’t made your donation” despite
            the user having made one. Avoid storing information that implies
            this or, if you do store it, provide strong security for that
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users with weak executive functioning are less likely to identify
            risks correctly so clearly identifying potential risks helps the
            user stay safe. Add helpful tips for staying safe while using your
            content and provide help in case of problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            To help identify risks, we suggest holding research and focus groups
            with people with cognitive and learning disabilities and to work
            with people with disabilities to solve potential and existing
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, many people who cannot copy and paste passwords or use
            two-step authorization codes ask a caregiver to help them. As
            caregivers are often just temporary employees, this leaves the user
            completely exposed. Making passwords longer or requiring users
            change them regularly increases these unsafe practices and actually
            makes the application less secure for many people. This type of
            design error is common because people with cognitive and learning
            disabilities are left out of the user research and analysis.

      <p>
        Distractions can cause users with cognitive disabilities problems such
        as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They can lose focus on the current action;</li>
        <li>draw attention away from the task they are trying to do; and</li>
        <li>
          can be difficult for some users to know how to understand, avoid,
          and/or stop them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once users become distracted, it can be
        <strong>difficult for them to remember what they were doing</strong>.
        Then they can no longer complete their task at all. This is especially
        problematic for users with both low attention and impaired memory, such
        as users with dementia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Items like bread crumbs can help orientate the user and help the user
        restore the context when it is lost. (Making breadcrumbs clickable can
        also help the user undo mistakes.)

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          do an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Identify the different tasks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Can they achieve the activities easily without losing focus?</li>
          <li>
            Distract the user for a minute so that they lose focus. Can they get
            easily back to the task?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or
            tired?
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the user what would help them remember what they are doing such

            For people with memory or attention challenges, interruptions can
            make completing a task very difficult or impossible. This can
            include individuals with Dementia, those that have had a stroke or
            brain injury, and those taking medications with side effects
            impacting memory and/or attention. Certain types of interruptions or
            a certain number may cause them to give up, even if the task is very
            important. Interruptions can include sounds, content that visually
            appears or changes (e.g. ads on a page). It can be as simple as text
            notifications about the presence of new changes while working in a
            shared online document.
          </p>
          <p>
            A site will work best for those with memory or attention challenges
            if they:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have no interruptions at all,</li>
            <li>
              Have an easy to use pause option so interruptions can be viewed
              later, or
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a setting where users can select which types of interruptions
              they prefer.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Many news websites have a lot of interruptions that can cause
            challenges for people needing to read important information, such as
            school closures due to bad weather. They may encounter breaking news
            text, advertisements, and pop-up windows. For those with difficulty
            focusing and sifting through the school names, or have two or three
            they need to check, these distractions may make the task impossible.
            By letting the user pause these distractions, and ideally
            temporarily remove them from the page, they will better be able to
            complete the task.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where standard techniques exists for the above, they should be used.

              Microsoft Office 365 lets the user decide how they want to be
              notified about reminders and emails. Users can choose visual
              reminders and/or sounds, or none. For some users, not having any

          <p>
            Too much text, too many images and too much other content can cause
            cognitive overload, anxiety and loss of focus. Keeping content down
            to a small number of important points reduces the clutter, calms the
            mind and allows for better understanding whilst aiding memory. In
            particular, it helps those with a short attention span who may leave
            the page if it appears complex.

            Avoiding long paragraphs and non-meaningful imagery ensures those

            Keeping to a few short bullet points and limiting to one or two

            The intent of this Pattern is not to clutter the page with
            unnecessary information but to provide important cues and
            instructions that will benefit people with disabilities. Too much
            information or instruction can be just as much of a hindrance as too
            little. The goal is to make certain that enough information is
            provided for the user to accomplish the task without undue confusion
            or navigation.

        Do not put barriers that stop people with cognitive disabilities from
        using or getting to content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many users have memory issues and/or language issues that can make
        remembering passwords or remembering numbers, while processing words,
        difficult or impossible. That can make transcribing text or remembering
        passwords difficult or impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes security and authentication put a barrier between users and
        the tasks they are doing. For example, requiring remembering and/or
        transcribing passwords often blocks users with cognitive disabilities
        from accessing content or using a service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes developers put a menu barrier between users and the task they
        are doing so users cannot use the content or service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Voice XML enables voice dialog systems and voice browsers. An example
        might be a phone menu system that ask you "dial 1 for internal services,
        dial 2 for external services, dial 9 for billing services." Sometimes
        users need to hold multiple pieces of transitory information in their
        minds, such as a number being presented as an option, while processing
        terms that follow. Many people with impaired short term memory cannot
        hold more than two or three pieces of information in their at the same
        time so they cannot do this task and cannot get to the place they need
        to be.
      </p>
      <p>When possible, provide easy-to-use options.</p>
      <p>Note that a lot can be achieved through supporting personalization.</p>

            Many people with week memory often lose the password and not be able
            to login and use their applications. Their solutions often are only
            sometimes helpful and have security risks:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              They may have to look at or listen to text several times to copy
              or type it into a form field;
            </li>
            <li>
              They may reuse a single passwords; or a simple-to-remember
              passwords, which they can remember. This is a security risk;
            </li>
            <li>
              If they need to change their password or use a complicated
              password they may keep passwords insecurely, such as written on
              pieces of paper which people can see.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>They may also struggle with other steps of login, such as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Enter characters in the correct order;</li>
            <li>
              Enter characters correctly on the first try (resulting in being
              locked out).Some people with cognitive disabilities may not be
              able to;
            </li>
            <li>Find a PIN;</li>
            <li>Work out puzzles or distorted letters;</li>
            <li>
              They can also give up after getting frustrated with time-limited
              procedures or presentations of digital security tokens.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Without this design requirement, many people cannot use an
            application or content at all. See

            partly responsible for the reduced life expectancy of people with
            learning and cognitive disabilities.

          <p>
            Many people cannot use voice menu systems and other complex systems.
            This often stops people from critical tasks by themselves. Often
            this can include: making doctors' appointments, getting health
            insurance, reaching social services, get their water turned back on,
            etc..
          </p>
          <p>
            If people can ]not manage menus by themselves they have to ask
            someone else to help them. For example they may delay making a
            doctor’s appointment or other critical task as not to bother their
            helper. This is a huge problem and means people often do not get the
            help they need or get it too late. This may be partly responsible
            for the lower life expectancy of people with learning and cognitive
            disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            See
            <a href="https://rawgit.com/w3c/coga/master/issue-papers/voice-menus.html">Voice Menu Systems</a>
            issue paper for a full discussion.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Why can’t people use complex menus?</strong></p>
          <p>
            A good short term memory (several seconds) is essential so that the
            user can remember the number or the term for the menu. Without these
            functions the user is likely to select the wrong number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many users have a small short term memory. For example, if you can
            remember 7 letters or items in your head at the same time they may
            be able to remember one or two. This makes them less likely to
            manage a menu system correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an
            option:
          </p>
          <p>
            May have an option "Press 3 for internal services" To use this
            option the user must remember a digit 3 whilst figuring out if they
            need an internal service. Many people cannot do this. It also
            requires them to press the correct digit.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct
            option the user may give up, especially if they did not understand
            all the earlier options and information
          </p>
          <p>
            The 0 digit should be reserved for reaching a person. Consistently
            set the first option for each menu to: "to weight for a person who
            can help you press 0". This can help everyone reach the support they
            need.

          <p>Considerations for Speech Recognition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For speech recognition based systems, an existing ETSI standard
              for voice commands for many European languages exists and should
              be used where possible [ETSI 202 076], keeping in mind that
              expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden
              on the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their
              requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have
              difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty
              mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural
              language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have
              difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog
              (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
          <p>
            For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255
            Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input,
            control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to
            cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable
            without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be
            operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.

          previous steps, and a mechanism for traversing the process.

            Often content has barrier which prevent users with learning
            disability from completing a step, and as a result, prevents them
            from achieving whatever they wished to achieve.
          </p>
          <p>
            This often happens in multi-step user-interaction dialogs, such as
            voice-menu systems, but it can happen in any task including online
            shopping or forms.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some systems assume that all users have a good working memory.
              They present several choices to the user and ask them to select
              one choice, whether by speaking or through a key press. The user
              needs hold multiple pieces of transitory information in the mind.
              For example many users have a small short term memory. For example
              a phone menu system (voice ML system) may have an option: "press 3
              for internal services" To use this option the user must remember a
              digit 3 whilst figuring out if they need an internal service. Many
              people cannot do this. It also requires them to press the correct
              digit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Reduced executive function may also cause problems. Sometime the
              user needs more time to complete a task. But she can be problems
              also if when the system response is too slow. The user may not
              know whether their input has registered with the system, and
              consequently may press the key or speak again.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use needs may need to compare similar options such as
              "billing", "accounts", "sales" and decide which is the service
              that is best suited to solve the issue at hand. Without strong
              reasoning skills the user is likely to select the wrong menu
              option.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisements and additional, unrequested information also
              increase the amount of processing required.
            </li>
            <li>
              The use needs to focus on the different options and select the
              correct one. A person with impaired attention may have not be able
              to focus for a long or multi-level menu. Advertising and
              additional, unrequested information also make it harder to retain
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user needs to interpret the correct terms and match them to
              their needs within a certain time limit. This involves speech
              perception and language understanding: sounds of language are
              heard, interpreted and understood, within a given time.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user needs to understand the terms used in the menu, even if
              they are not relevant to the service options required.
            </li>
            <li>
              When a lot of irrelevant information is given before the correct
              option the user may give up, especially if they did not understand
              all the earlier options and information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Allowing the 0 digit to get to a person, or having the first option
            "to weight for a person who can help you press 0" can consistently
            help.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each step in a sequential process must contain the information
            necessary to allow a user to proceed. They must NOT rely on memory
            from prior steps. When useful, provide a summary of information from

            Follow best practices in general
            <abbr title="voice user interfaces">VUI</abbr> design
          </p>
          <p>
            Standard best practices in voice user interface apply to users with
            cognitive disabilities, and should be followed. A good reference is
            published by The Association for Voice Interaction Design Wiki
            [AVIxD]. Another good reference is [ETSI ETR 096]. Some examples of
            generally accepted best practices in voice user interface design:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pauses are important between phrases in order to allow processing
              time of language and options.
            </li>
            <li>
              Options in text should be given before the digit to select, or the
              instruction to select that option. This will mean that the user
              does not need to remember the digit or instruction whilst
              processing the term. For example: The prompt "press 1 for the
              secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1 while
              interpreting the term "secretary". A better prompt is "for the
              secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the secretary (pause) or for
              more help (pause): press 1"
            </li>
            <li>
              Error recovery should be simple, and take the user to a human
              operator if the error persists. Error responses should not end the
              call or send the user to a more complex menu.
            </li>
            <li>
              Advertisements and other extraneous information should not be read
              as it can confuse the user and can make it harder to retain
              attention.
            </li>
            <li>Terms used should be as simple and jargon-free as possible.</li>
            <li>
              Tapered prompts should be used to increase the level of prompt
              detail when the user does not respond as expected.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            See the AVIxD wiki cited above for additional recommendation and
            detail.
          </p>
          <p><strong>User settings</strong></p>
          <p>
            User-specific settings can be used to customize the voice user
            interface (such as menus, and options), keeping in mind that the
            available mechanisms for invoking user-specific settings are minimal
            in a voice interface (speech or DTMF tones). If it is difficult to
            set user preferences, they won't be used. Setting preferences by
            natural language is the most natural ("slow down!") but is not
            currently very common.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Extra time should be a user setting for both the speed of speech
              and ability for the user to define if they need a slower speech or
              more input time etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).
            </li>
            <li>
              The user should be able to extend or disable time out as a system
              default on their device
            </li>
            <li>
              Error recovery should be simple, and take you to a human operator.
              Error response should not though the user off the line or send
              them to a more complex menu. Preferably they should use a reserved
              digit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timed text should be adjustable (as with all accessible media).

              Advertisement and other information should not be read as it can

                <li>
                  Example 1: Reducing cognitive load: The prompt "press 1 for
                  the secretary," requires the user to remember the digit 1
                  while interpreting the term secretary. It is less good then
                  the prompt "for the secretary (pause): press 1" or " for the
                  secretary (pause) or for more help (pause): press 1"
                </li>
                <li>
                  Example 2: Setting a default for a human operator as the

          <p>Considerations for Speech Recognition</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For speech recognition based systems, an existing ETSI standard
              for voice commands for many European languages exists and should
              be used where possible [ETSI 202 076], keeping in mind that
              expecting people to learn more than a few commands places a burden
              on the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Natural language understanding systems allow users to state their
              requests in their own words, and can be useful for users who have
              difficulty remembering menu options, or who have difficulty
              mapping the offered menu options to their goals. However, natural
              language interfaces can be difficult to use for users who have
              difficulty producing speech or language. Directed dialog
              (menu-based) fallback or transfer to an agent should be provided.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Follow requirements of legislation</p>
          <p>
            For example, the U.S. Telecommunications Act Section 255
            Accessibility Guidelines [Section255] paragraph 1193.41 Input,
            control, and mechanical functions, clauses (g), (h) and (i) apply to
            cognitive disabilities and require that equipment should be operable
            without time-dependent controls, the ability to speak, and should be
            operable by persons with limited cognitive skills.

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of
          cognitive disabilities. Do not just ask questions, but ask the user to
          do an action that demonstrates usability.
        </p>
        <p>Test for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Are enough user groups represented?</li>
          <li>
            For example a typical project may wish to include: People living

            intellectual disabilities, different specific learning disabilities
            and communication disorders.

          <li>
            Can the user find a way to submit their feedback without asking for
            help?
          </li>
          <li>
            Can the user submit their feedback at each stage of the process

          </li>
          <li>
            Ask the users if they would find this easy to do if under stress or

          <li>
            Ask the user where they might have trouble if they were under

          <li>
            Does the user understand the feedback process and are they able to
            complete the task? Use concrete ways to check that the user
            understands. For example: Is the user able to identify if/when they
            will receive a response back? The method a response back may come
            (e.g. email, phone). Where the feedback goes/what happens to the

          <li>
            Make sure it is simple to use and does not require a lot of
            information that will prevent !people from giving feedback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Confirm it is available at different stages in the process and is
            one click away.

          <p>
            The use of complex information, long documents and data in a
            particular format can present significant barriers to users with
            cognitive accessibility needs. Users should be able to understand
            the information and successfully complete described tasks without
            requiring further external assistance as much as possible. If
            content is sufficiently complex to cause barrier, it may be
            inaccessible and then additional supporting help should be provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The complexity of information may be inherent in the information
            itself, for example the language used, the quantity of information,
            or the subject matter. In this case, it is likely to need careful
            explanation, organization and presentation for all users to be able
            to understand without any mistakes, confusion or need of assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, the presentation mode of information, such as a graph,
            diagram or table, may obscure its meaning through complexity. Here,
            a supporting description and guided interpretation will highlight
            the key features the user needs to understand.
          </p>
          <p>Help may be provided in various forms, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Text "asides" providing explanation and help for diagrams.</li>

              For content with sections use one of the following:

                <li>Using enable semantics to add symbols to sections</li>
                <li>

                <li>
                  However as some people have difficulty remembering symbols,

            Some people confuse their left with their right and so will may be
            unable will be unable to use navigation systems. Others may
            experience difficulty recognizing relative and cardinal directions
            such as North, South, East, and West,
          </p>

          <p>
            Providing alternative terms relative and cardinal directions if
            possible, for example “the driver's side”. This is helped with
            personalization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider using any standard mechanism for the platform or

            cardinal directions and terms.

        <p>
          Provide help for any complex forms, particularly when there are
          multiple steps, unusual interactions, non-standard controls and
          required fields that do not support autocomplete.
        </p>

          <p>
            Users often find forms and related tasks to be the most complex
            experience with web sites and can easily become confused, unsure, or
            even completely lost. Providing extra help can make the difference
            between being able to successfully complete a task and giving up.
            This is especially true if any part of the form is complex or
            provides nonstandard interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many standard forms controls provide support automatically. For
            example, many fields can be automatically fill it all in the
            information using autocomplete or personalization semantics. Then
            the user will not make mistakes filling it out.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you require additional fields and nonstandard controls many
            users will have difficulty filling it in. Many users with
            disabilities will get the information incorrect or be unable to work
            out how to complete the task. Often this results in the task being
            completely abandoned. In other cases the user asks a care giver for
            help to complete the form or work the control. In either case they
            have not been able to complete the task because of their disability.

            The standard HTML forms and controls have been carefully specified
            for maximum usability and accessibility. They are usually understood
            by users, especially if they are familiar with web interactions.
            However, users are likely to experience difficulties if the standard
            form behavior has been altered or completely new controls are
            provided. Assuming the new behaviors have been carefully designed
            and user tested, users may still require help in order to
            successfully use them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples of forms and controls that are likely to require additional
            help:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              New behaviors like bank sort code fields where there is auto
              tabbing between the 3 boxes as digits are entered;
            </li>
            <li>
              Password fields that require certain character types of characters
              to be entered;
            </li>
            <li>
              Surveys with complex interactions, for example where buttons only
              appear depending on previous answers;
            </li>
            <li>
              Date entry where there could be some ambiguity about the required
              format;
            </li>
            <li>custom controls like date pickers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Help can be provided via various mechanisms, perhaps with an
            accessible help button next to a nonstandard control.

          Ensure easy access to a human who can provide help and support.
          Support can be on accessibility, technical, process or domain based.
        </p>
        <p>
          Access to human help should never require the user to manage complex
          menu systems such as voice menus with different options.

          </p>
          <p>
            One or more contact mechanisms should be easy to locate and use from
            any page or any step in a process.

            <li>
              An option for live chat or video call help. Note: It must be full

              help functionality;
            </li>
            <li>
              A phone number, ideally with a feature to automatically call via

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is important that voice communication is easy and this implies
            the person providing help can both be easily understood and is able
            to understand others, allowing for a range of vocal and verbal
            characteristics. Sensitivity to the requirements of people with
            learning cognitive disabilities is also important.

          <p>
            People with cognitive and learning difficulties often have
            challenges managing events and time. In fact, being unable to
            correctly manage events and time without support is a diagnostic
            criteria for some groups of disabilities. This results in missing
            meetings, not submitting a request by a certain date or a form
            within a specified time period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using calendar APIs (or task manager) that allow the user to
            automatically add events and deadlines to their own calendar can
            help in many cases, for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When the user copies information into a calendar they often copy
              the day or time incorrectly.
            </li>
            <li>
              The user is challenged processing and retaining time based
              information.
            </li>
            <li>The user is challenged in sequencing time bound events.</li>
            <li>
              The user's skills decrease when tired to such an extent that they
              have to stop a task. They may wish to reschedule the task.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For example, a user with a learning disability set a doctor's
            appointment online. Often they copy the detailing incorrectly onto
            their calendar. However, the website gives them an option to add the
            appointment to the calendar and sets a reminder an hour before. The
            user now comes to the correct place at the correct time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The benefit to users with cognitive accessibility needs is that they
            can independently manage appointments, deadlines and schedules. The
            ability to set reminders can reduce the cognitive load associated
            when processing time bound tasks. Time dependent activities may be
            monitored and tracked by the user to ensure that they are completed
            in a timely manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always give the option to set a reminder at the end of the task so
            that the user does not get interrupted.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is essential not to add unwanted reminders as this makes the
            user's calendar too full. This can even prevent them from being able
            to use their calendar at all. The user is the best person to know
            how many reminders, and which type, will best meet their needs.

            may be defined by a calendar date and time or by the total elapsed
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Variables that could be considered on 'when to supply a reminder'
            include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Time - at a logical time</li>
            <li>Location - prompted when at an appropriate location</li>
            <li>Context - on computer vs. mobile, on specific site, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This design pattern addresses two broad classes of issues associated
            with this type of information:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the user perceives the activity to be too complex the user may
              decide to abandon the activity and therefore be excluded from the
              information and/or services derived from the completion of the
              activity.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the activity relies on a number of distinct events being
              carried out sequentially over an extended period of time or if a
              single event must be completed by a specified date and time then
              the likelihood of errors being made during the activity increases,
              particularly for users with cognitive accessibility needs.
              Activities are often missed because the date and time is confused.

          Make it easy for the user to ask for help or report issues. This
          includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Easy to Use: Feedback information and forms are simple and clear.
            (User testing with different user groups is highly recommended.)
          </li>

            Easy to Find: Available from any place where the user may get stuck
          </li>

        <p>
          The option to provide feedback should never require the user to manage
          complex menu systems such as Integrated Voice Menus (IVR) with many
          different options.

            Providing an easy way for users to give feedback will help people be
            able to share problems, ask for help, make suggestions and positive
            comments. If users cannot give feedback easily, problems will
            continue to exist without the site owner being aware of the
            problems. Ideas for improvements and positive feedback will also be
            missed.

            <li>Does not make the user provide unnecessary information;</li>
            <li>Does not rely on complex menu systems.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Providing multiple methods for gathering feedback is recommended.
            For example, on a website, consider providing all 4 options for
            feedback including live chat, a phone number, a web form and a
            feedback email address.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that chat bots may not be appropriate for this particular type
            of feedback other than to start the feedback process. These can be
            extremely frustrating if you cannot easily get to the area you are
            trying to reach.

            A banking website had a major accessibility problem. This problem
            blocked some customers from paying their bills online. One of these
            customers found a feedback form on the page where they got stuck.
            The customer was able to report the problem. A help desk employee
            reached out to the customer and helped them complete their bill
            payment successfully. That help desk employee also reported the
            accessibility problem to the software team. The software team
            corrected the problem in the next software release. The new design
            was easier for all users and resulted in more customers successfully
            paying their bills on time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Web Chat or Web Call - An option to provide feedback using live
              chat or a video call. Note: The live chat or video call feature
              must be fully accessible. Web chat should not be a distraction and
              easy to close. Check usability with user testing.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phone - A feedback phone number, ideally with a feature to
              automatically call via Voice over IP. Make sure there are no
              complex voice menus.
            </li>
            <li>
              Web Form - A simple site contact form with no more than 3 required
              fields
            </li>
            <li>
              Email - An email link using the "mailto" protocol with prefilled
              “to” and “subject” fields. Note will not work on all platforms or
              all mail clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              Interactive Voice Response (IVR) - Provide an automatic option at

      <p>
        Personalization can enable us to really meet the individual user’s
        needs. Some users need extra support which we can provide with minimal
        effort from the user via personalization. Personalization allows the
        user to select preferred options from a set of alternatives. Some
        alternatives may be provided by the content author or app developer and
        others may be semi automated. This can include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiar symbols and graphics that the user knows;</li>
        <li>Tool tips;</li>
        <li>
          Language they understand such as literal language or common terms;
        </li>
        <li>
          Less features and options to the optimum number for the individual
          user;
        </li>
        <li>Keyboard short cuts that are familiar to the user;</li>
        <li>Widgets for help.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Personalization also helps with the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sometimes user needs conflict;</li>
        <li>
          Learning new designs, patterns and widgets can be confusing - we want
          to allow users use widgets they already know;
        </li>
        <li>Extra support can be annoying to people who do not need it;</li>
        <li>
          Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility for some
          people but can often be considered boring design for other users;
        </li>
        <li>
          Ability to change levels of complexity and simplify the content is
          important as people skills improve or decrease over time or context.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One use-case we would like to see is providing interoperable symbol set
        codes for non-verbal users. Products for people who are non-vocal often
        use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact peoples
        language. Unfortunately, many of these symbols are both subject to copy
        write and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one
        device, and can-not use apps or AT from a different company. An open set
        of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be
        interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol
        set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or
        applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be
        interoperable.

          Make sure your user testing includes individuals with a range of

          do an action that demonstrates usability.

        <p>Test to ensure that:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>
            Content variations such as text simplification do do not incorrectly
            change the meaning, that content is not lost, and that critical
            paths still work;

            People with cognitive disabilities are often using add-ons or
            extensions as assistive technology. This includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reading of the long form of acronyms;</li>
            <li>
              Support for text-to-speech with synchronized highlighting of the
              phrase being read;
            </li>
            <li>Content simplification;</li>
            <li>Creating mind maps out of the heading structure;</li>
            <li>
              Support for retaining content that has already been entered;
            </li>
            <li>Password management;</li>
            <li>Spell checking;</li>
            <li>Changing the symbols or the interface.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If these functions are not supported, the author should provide all
            support all the functions of the add-ons in use as assistive
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a user with traumatic brain injury has executive
            function and memory impairments impacting their ability to remember
            details such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Internet of Things (IoT) interface</li>
            <li>Their user name and password</li>
            <li>What an acronym stands for</li>
            <li>A phone number</li>
            <li>The meaning of uncommon words</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Supporting the use of an add-on that simplifies content and adds
            help (such as the long form of acronyms, and a popup dictionary)
            enables them to understand most content.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supporting password management tools enables him to successfully
            login and avoid being locked out of secure sites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Storing non-sensitive information and auto complete helps them fill
            out a form. This suggests common information, like a person's phone
            number or address. It also helps them avoid making mistakes. It
            eliminates the need for accurately recalling this information from
            memory or having to copy and paste it, which is a task that often
            prevent them from successfully using a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            When overwhelmed by textual content, they have an extension that
            inserts symbols that they are familiar with that helps them find the
            content they need.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, sometimes a web site stops their extensions and API’s from
            working. The result is that the use cannot use this web site.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another example is a person that has a language related disability
            (e.g. Dyslexia) which may cause them to read at a slower rate. They
            often miss objects and information that they did not know they
            needed to read. While high-literacy readers scan text, low-literacy
            users may read the text “word-for-word.” This means they only know
            what is written when they have intentionally read out. This is
            similar to having a narrow field of view and they can be unaware of
            other items not directly in the flow of text that they are reading.
            They may also miss things on the page that help them understand what
            to do. For example, there may be a side bar or call out box which
            helps make decisions about which link to go to that matches their
            particular needs. These readers may select the earlier option they
            encounter, because they may not have noticed (or prioritized)
            reading that side bar content. They also might miss information that
            is essential for successfully completing an interaction.
          </p>

          <p>
            Too many options may add to the complexity of interacting with IoT
            devices. Additional options should be easy to ignore and not require
            a lot of reading to understand that they are additional, as well as
            how to skip them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes IoT interfaces may confuse the user, such as a default
            "reading" on a meter being set to “2” and not “1.” The user would
            then need to reset it to “1.”
          </p>

            It is important in any proposed solution to make operational tasks,
            such as interacting with the IoT, as transparent as possible so that
            users can focus their attention on the functional aspects, such as
            relating to content.

            People with cognitive disabilities are often using add-ons as
            assistive technology. It is essential that add-ons and similar tools
            work. Otherwise, we need to make the author support all the
            functions of the add-ons in use as assistive technology.

            A user who has difficulty reading or using Web content can be easily
            overwhelmed with too much information on a web page. They need to
            simplify the page to just the critical information that they need
            and not spend all their energy reading and understanding other
            content and features. This is also true for users who are easily
            distracted.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, an email program has lots of features and formatting
            options when drafting an email. This makes it too complex for a lot
            of people. With personalization the user can have a simple options
            with only send and cancel options. There is a “to” and subject line
            but no cc or bcc options. In this setting there is a clear heading
            (write an email) and they have icons that the user understands.

        <p>
          Add semantics on control links and symbols that allows extra support
          that is appropriate for each user. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Html 5 autocomplete on common fields;</li>
          <li>Adding a toolbar that adds personalized images;</li>
          <li>Use attributes in personalization semantics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Personalization technology is still young and is developing rapidly.
          At the time of publication HTML autocorrect on fields was the best
          supported.
        </p>
        <section id="how-it-helps-47">
          <h5 id="a-9-5-1-how-it-helps"><bdi class="secno">A.9.5.1 </bdi>How it helps<a class="self-link" aria-label="§" href="#how-it-helps-47"></a></h5>
          <p>
            Personalization changes the interface to meet the needs of the user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to
            use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be
            unfamiliar to another requiring them to learn new symbols. Adding
            semantics allow symbols and support to be added by an extension or
            browser that is familiar to the individual user.
          </p>
          <p>
            A stronger example is people using Alternative and Augmentative
            Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems designed for people who are
            non-verbal often use symbols with or without text.
          </p>
          <p>
            These users usually only learn one symbol set. They cannot easily
            communicate with other symbol users in a written format or may
            struggle to understand different symbols used in different
            applications. Some symbols are subject to copyright and cannot be
            shared across applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            If users' symbols are mapped to the same concepts, then user agents
            can load the symbols that are understandable by the user and they
            user can access the web and other applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other support include autocomplete and extension that help the user
            fill out forms and understand the content. Many users with memory or
            executive functions impairments could not fill in forms without
            asking someone to help copy over information or check their work.
            Autocomplete, many more users to manage forms by themselves.
